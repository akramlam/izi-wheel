# JWT Login Error Fix

## Issue Summary
The iziwheel API application was experiencing login failures with the following error:

```
Login error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sign')
    at generateToken (/var/www/iziwheel/apps/api/src/utils/jwt.js:38:35)
    at login (/var/www/iziwheel/apps/api/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts:84:32)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurred because:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: The `node_modules` were not properly installed in the monorepo workspace
2. **Incorrect Import Syntax**: The JWT utility file was using `import * as jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'` which was causing the `jwt` object to be undefined
3. **Missing Prisma Client**: The Prisma client was not generated, causing additional TypeScript compilation errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /workspace
pnpm install
```
- Used `pnpm` instead of `npm` since this is a pnpm workspace monorepo
- Successfully installed 907 packages including `jsonwebtoken@9.0.2`

### 2. Fix JWT Import Statement
**Before:**
```typescript
import * as jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
```
- Changed from namespace import to default import to ensure proper module resolution

### 3. Generate Prisma Client
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run prisma:generate
```
- Generated the Prisma client to resolve TypeScript compilation errors
- Ensured all Prisma types (User, Role, etc.) are available for import

### 4. Verify Fix
```bash
npm run build
```
- TypeScript compilation completed successfully with no errors

## Files Modified
- `apps/api/src/utils/jwt.ts` - Fixed import statement on line 1

## Dependencies Verified
- `jsonwebtoken@9.0.2` - Properly installed and accessible
- `@types/jsonwebtoken@9.0.5` - TypeScript definitions available
- `@prisma/client@5.9.1` - Generated and working

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The JWT token generation should now work correctly, resolving the login authentication errors.

## Next Steps
The PM2 application should be restarted to pick up the compiled changes:
```bash
pm2 restart iziwheel-api
```
