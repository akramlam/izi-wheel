# Wheel Slot Alignment - Permanent Fix

## Problem Fixed
**Issue**: "Lot gagné ne correspond pas à la flèche" - Prize won doesn't match wheel arrow position.

## Root Cause
The API endpoints returned slots in database order, but the spin logic used stable sorting. This created a mismatch between visual wheel position and actual winning slot.

## Permanent Solution Applied

### Backend Fix
Updated `apps/api/src/controllers/public.controller.ts` to ensure ALL API endpoints return slots in the same stable-sorted order used by the spin logic.

**Key Change**: Added `applyStableSorting()` to all slot arrays returned by API endpoints:

```typescript
// Before (inconsistent)
slots: wheel.slots.map(slot => ({ ... }))

// After (consistent) 
slots: applyStableSorting(wheel.slots).map(slot => ({ ... }))
```

### Endpoints Fixed
- ✅ `getPublicWheel` - All return paths now use stable sorting
- ✅ `getCompanyWheel` - Company route uses stable sorting  
- ✅ `spinWheel` - Already used stable sorting (was correct)

## Result
- Wheel arrow now points to correct winning slot
- Visual wheel matches actual prize selection
- Consistent behavior across all wheels
- No more slot mismatches

## No Scripts Needed
This is a permanent code fix. No manual scripts or database updates required. The fix automatically applies to all existing and new wheels.
